                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                   <p>For the final, I have decided to reiterate the <strong>Madlib Project</strong>. I will refine the form layout, type hierarchy, background image, and color choice.</p>

                <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
                   <p>During the research, I came across a great mad libs design, <strong> <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~elmiles/sonvday/story_html5.html">SON IT Greeting</a>, </strong> by Elizabeth Miles. I found this through E-Learning Heros's "Mad Libs in E-Learning" article. I think the layout, interface, and directions of the design were well executed. Miles added hover interaction on the buttons. There was also a call-out with an animation which I thought was very creative. I also liked how everything was not stacked on one page and was distributed throughout several pages. Yet, if I were to make any changes, I would size down the overall design and leave some margins on each side of the page. </p>

                <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
                    <p>Again, through E-Learning Heros's "Mad Libs in E-Learning" article. I found another great mad libs project,<strong> <a href="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/owenportfoliobucket/Mad+Libs+Karaoke+-+Storyline+output/story_html5.html">Mad Libs Karaoke</a>, </strong> by Sarah Owen. I found this very interactive and inspiring. Right from the beginning until the end, it was very engaging. There were music and game sound effect added which went very well with the theme. There were micro-interactions, background animation, a pop-up box (answer box for the confusion i:e 'noun, adverb, etc). I think by adding all of these factors, Owen made a very successful design. Yet, if I were to make any changes, I would add "Re-start" or "Play Again" button at the end.</p>

                <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                   <p>My goal for the project is to make the background and foreground more interactive. Right now, it looks very flat and it does not have enough interactions for users to enjoy. Like Sarah Owen in her, "Mad Libs Kataoke", incorporated images and music related to the theme, I want to enhance those techniques. I also want to make the 'form' larger and readable for users.</p>

                <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                   <p>For the overall look and feel, I will have to change the overall background design. For instance: for color choice, since my Mad Libs is about Singing, I want to go with purple, blue, pink, and neon yet I want to make it look balanced. Also, for proportion and hierarchy, I want to iterate the form size and make it larger than how it currently looks.</p>

                <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                   <p>For interaction, I want to incorporate sound effects and gif animations to make the overall design look more lively. As for the form, I want to add a 'color hover effect' and sound effect when clicked on the buttons and more. Moreover, I also want to add a "play again" button, which I had missed adding on the initial project. I also want to add a pop-up box with descriptions to help people if there is any confusion</p>

                <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                   <p>My goal is to make the design interactive and fun for the audience to play. My original mad libs idea was to make it funny, so I'll still keep that and add fun interactions (funny sound effect). I will try to create better graphic illustrations and gifs for the background. Yet, I will also keep track of consistency and add not too many details to confuse the audience.</p>
