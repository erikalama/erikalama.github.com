                <h3>3 Common Feedbacks:</h3>
                   <p><em>"Music is a bit loud. Maybe add an option for the users to either pause and play."</em></p>
                   <p><em>"For the output result, add a little more spacing and maybe increase the size of the font."</em></p>
                   <p><em>"The styling and illustration look great, and it goes very well with the overall theme."</em></p>

                <h2>Music Volume Error</h2>
                   <p>During the user test, one significant observation I noted was the error with the music volume. I found that all three users found music volume to be a little too loud. Some of them suggested adding an option for users to pause and play the music. While some suggested adding a different track with lower volume.</p> 

                    <p>While in the process of designing/coding, I had not noticed the issue with the volume being that loud, because I had my computer volume low. However, during the test, even I was shocked by the loud music. Hence, I will work on this issue and try to incorporate an illustration that shows an option to pause and play the music. Or, I will create an overlay where I will add the game instruction and an alert message for the volume.</p>

                <h2>Line Spacing</h2>
                   <p>Another significant observation I noted was the narrowed line spacing of the output result. <em>"For the output result, add a little more spacing and maybe increase the size of the font."</em> Users stated that the output result of the form had a narrower spacing between lines. They suggested increasing the line spacing and also changing the font-family.  I had initially tried using a scripted font which was hard to read, so I had gone back to using sans serif font. However, I will try using different font families to match the theme of my design.</p>
                   <p>I also received feedback about the output message not being clear, so I will also consider that and change the narrative structure to make it more understandable.</p>

                <h2>Styling and Illustration</h2>
                   <p>Users mentioned that the illustrations and the animations worked very well. <em>"The styling and illustration look great, and it goes very well with the overall theme."</em> They stated that the background gradient and the animations highlighted the overall theme and made it more fun while they were filling the form. For some users, it reminded them of a significant place, such as being at a party. Moreover, despite the music being a little loud, they stated that it created a mood for them, and it was a fun touch to the overall design. </p>
