                   <p><strong>Best practices for form design</strong> ~ I enjoyed the reading as it was very informative and helpful. As a designer, it is crucial for us to comprehend these basic design choices, because it can affect our design if not implemented correctly. The reading also provided a complete explanation of why each of these steps is important to make a design successful.</p>
                   <p> Some steps provided in the reading were the steps I had already known, yet I did find some new and helpful tips. For instance, Distinguish Optional and Required fields, Provide Matching Keyboard, and Never use a Reset or Clear button were something that I had not thought of. I have had experienced some issues with the "Reset or Clear button" while filling applications. But I had never thought of it as a design problem. It is rather to eliminate the reset button if applicable as it is mentioned in the article, "If users click on a Reset button instead of a Submit button, their effort will be gone, and they may not fill the form again"
