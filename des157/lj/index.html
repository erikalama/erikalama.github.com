                   <p><strong>Game Design UX Best Practices
                    By ~ Amir Dori ~ 04/16/19</strong> 
                    I think the article by Dori on Best Practices for Game Design was very informative. I learned a lot from this article, and as a student focusing on UI design, I think I will keep referring back to this article again in the future. From the article, I learned many great strategies. For instance, "to use 'Close' button instead of 'X' button," "invisible skip button (or shown for 2.5s when tapped) for intro video," and it was also interesting how Dori mentioned the dark-UX. Also, it was interesting to learn how designers have to pay close attention to many detailed designs since the screen’s real-estate is limited. </p>

                <h4>Visual Thinking Analysis</h4>
                   <img src="images/IMG_2303.jpg" alt="Buddha">
                   <figcaption>Buddhism - Erika Lama, 2021.</figcaption>
                   <p>This image is interesting because it has a connection to my family and our belief in Buddhism. Through this image, you can see the collection of Buddhist gods and goddesses my family has gathered over twenty-five years. There are a total of twenty-seven gold-plated statues, each statue represents a different narrative. Moreover, towards the bottom of the image(on the table), you can see four layers of bowls filled with water, and some fruits on the basket, which is an offering to the god.</p>
                   <p>		This image relates to the topic of an archive as well as a collection because some of the statues are passed down from my great grandparents. The passing from past generations to future generations, I think it makes it an archive piece.</p>
                   <p>I think the collection shows that I am a spiritual person. For me, I feel like following any religion, whether that be Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, or Christianity, all teach us to pass on the positivity to the world. As I have a deep admiration toward the art world, these collections are also like an art collection for me, because every statue is handmade (from Nepal), and the details on the statue look surreal.</p>

                   <p>.</p>
        
                   <img src="images/breakers.JPG" alt="breakers">
                   <figcaption>Breakers - Emily Lam, 2021.</figcaption>
                   <p>	The image is about a mural done seemingly in the early 1500s during the high renaissance period. I think the most interesting aspect of this image is the richness and vivid details that draw all the attention. It almost looks machine-made rather than hand made because of the rich details. One obvious aspect of the image tells me that Emily may have visited this place and she loves to take photographs of archive sites. And the mysterious aspect is that why did Emily choose this picture and what story resonates with her.

                   <p><strong>Every Picture,</strong> During the research, I found a website called "Climber.io," which stands for Interactive Production Company. I think this website has done an amazing job of creating interactive CSS and Js animations to convey their information. The interaction of mouse hover, use of images on different sections, scroll arrows functions, typography, etc. These functions are well designed and engage the viewers' attention. During the research, when I reviewed other websites, I went through their interaction and left to look for other websites. However, After I found this Climber.io, their pages were so well designed that I went through all of their pages. I found it very interesting and inspiring.</p>
                   <p>Additionally, I also found another website, "Polish Christmas Guide." On this website, they have also made amazing CSS and Js animations, and have also used the sound effect. On this website, I think they have used the overlay function to deliver the message to the audience.

                   <p><strong>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</strong> ~ In my opinion, the reading, Modal Windows by Naema Baskanderi was very informative. It is interesting to know how much effort is used to make these pop-up windows work, but I realized that most of the time, I choose to close the windows without even looking at the content. As mention in the article, the title, button, focus, sizing & location, etc are important to grasp the users' attention. However, I think the idea behind "User Initiated" is more applicable. Rather than surprising the user as mentioned in the article, "don’t surprise users by popping up a modal. Let a user’s action, such as a button click, following a link, or selecting an option, trigger the modal. "

                   <p><strong>Best practices for form design</strong> ~ I enjoyed the reading as it was very informative and helpful. As a designer, it is crucial for us to comprehend these basic design choices, because it can affect our design if not implemented correctly. The reading also provided a complete explanation of why each of these steps is important to make a design successful.</p>
                   <p> Some steps provided in the reading were the steps I had already known, yet I did find some new and helpful tips. For instance, Distinguish Optional and Required fields, Provide Matching Keyboard, and Never use a Reset or Clear button were something that I had not thought of. I have had experienced some issues with the "Reset or Clear button" while filling applications. But I had never thought of it as a design problem. It is rather to eliminate the reset button if applicable as it is mentioned in the article, "If users click on a Reset button instead of a Submit button, their effort will be gone, and they may not fill the form again"
